This is a basic VR Shooting game with interactable items(in this game you shoot the bottle)
I have used some assets from unity store and some 3D AI generated 
there is one problem in this -- Since i don't have a ouest 2 now i used a simulator and there is a bug in that simulator that just dosen't show the images in a canvas so that I wasn't able to test the 2D transition
I have disabled the transition or 2D interface for now 
You can try it by enabling it in (XR Origin > Camera Offset > Main Camera > Intro Screen) you need to enable intro screen 
without enabling it you can experience the 3D world and the gameplay
